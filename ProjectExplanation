Project Synopsis: Docker Jenkins Pipeline for Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Version Tracking

The objective of this project is to build a Docker Jenkins pipeline that showcases a seamless continuous integration 
and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow. Additionally, it aims to deploy a Node.js todo list application on AWS while 
diligently tracking its versions on GitHub whenever a code is committed to the repository.

To achieve this, the project will utilize Docker containers to encapsulate the application and its dependencies, 
ensuring consistency and portability across different environments. Jenkins, a popular automation server, will be employed 
to automate the CI/CD process.

The workflow will begin with developers committing their code changes to a designated repository on GitHub. 
Jenkins, configured with a webhook, will detect these commits and trigger a pipeline. The pipeline will consist 
of several stages, including building the Docker image, running tests, and deploying the application to the AWS infrastructure.

The Node.js todo list application will be containerized using Docker, facilitating easy deployment and scaling. 
AWS services, such as EC2 or ECS, will be utilized to host the application. 
Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform can be employed to provision the necessary resources automatically.

To ensure proper version tracking, every code commit to the GitHub repository will be logged and associated with a specific version. 
This allows for easy identification and comparison of different iterations of the project. 
GitHub's version control capabilities will be leveraged to maintain a comprehensive history of the application's development.

The project will demonstrate the benefits of a CI/CD workflow, such as automated testing, faster deployment cycles, and improved collaboration among team members. 
By leveraging Docker, Jenkins, AWS, and GitHub, the pipeline will provide an efficient and reliable 
means of continuously integrating, delivering, and tracking the Node.js todo list application throughout its development lifecycle.
